I presently work in the electronic medical records field, and have a background in consumer internet sites that support millions of views a day.

When I'm not reloading the page, I play [Old-Time music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old-time_music) on the fiddle and banjo.

A lot of developers are scared of the Real-Time Web and the programming challenges / mystique surrounding it.  I would like to show the world that it's not so bad =)
